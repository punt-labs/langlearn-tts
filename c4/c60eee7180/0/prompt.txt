OK, two things: 1 audit your permissions and simplify them based on the standard ../punt-kit/ 2. make sure your CLAUDE.md is consistent workflow wise with ../punt-kit/

# /notify command

Toggle audio notifications for Claude Code events.

## Usage

- `/notify y` — Notify on task completion and permission prompts
- `/notify c` — Continuous: also announce milestones (tests passed, lint clean, code pushed) in real-time
- `/notify n` — Off (default)

## Implementation

Use the `set_config` MCP tool for writes. Read `.tts/config.md` for
status queries.

- **y**: `set_config(key="notify", value="y")`
- **c**: `set_config(key="notify", value="c")`
- **n**: `set_config(key="notify", value="n")`
- **no argument**: Read `.tts/config.md` and report current state

After changing state, confirm with a brief message:

- `y`: "Notifications on. You'll hear when tasks finish or need approval."
- `c`: "Continuous notifications on. You'll also hear real-time milestones."
- `n`: "Notifications off."


ARGUMENTS: y

# /voice command

Control TTS voice mode and session voice selection.

## Usage

- `/voice on` — Enable voice mode (speak text responses as audio)
- `/voice off` — Disable voice mode
- `/voice status` — Show current voice mode and session voice
- `/voice <name>` — Set the session voice (e.g. `/voice aria`)
- `/voice clear` — Clear the session voice (revert to provider default)

## Implementation

Use the `set_config` MCP tool for writes. Read `.tts/config.md` for
status queries.

- **on**: `set_config(key="voice_enabled", value="true")`
- **off**: `set_config(key="voice_enabled", value="false")`
- **status**: Read `.tts/config.md` and report voice_enabled state and
  session voice. If the file doesn't exist, voice mode is off and no
  session voice is set.
- **`<name>`**: `set_config(key="voice", value="<name>")` — sets
  the session voice. All subsequent speak/chorus/duet/ensemble calls
  will use this voice as default (unless overridden per-call).
  Common ElevenLabs voices: matilda, aria, roger, charlie, sarah, laura.
- **clear**: `set_config(key="voice", value="")` — clears the session
  voice so calls revert to the provider's default.

After changing state, confirm the action to the user.

OK, now follow the workflow to get our changes merged, via PR, copilot fb etc.
