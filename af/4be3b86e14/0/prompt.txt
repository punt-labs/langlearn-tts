Implement the following plan:

# Release v0.6.3

## Context

The output directory consolidation fix (PR #29, lltts-612) is merged to main. Users on `0.6.2` may get files written to cwd instead of `~/langlearn-audio`. We need to release `0.6.3` to PyPI and build a new `.mcpb` Desktop Extension bundle.

## Version bump: 0.6.2 → 0.6.3

Three files to update:
- `pyproject.toml:3` — `version = "0.6.2"` → `"0.6.3"`
- `src/langlearn_tts/__init__.py:7` — `__version__ = "0.6.2"` → `"0.6.3"`
- `manifest.json:5` — `"version": "0.6.2"` → `"0.6.3"`

## CHANGELOG

Move `[Unreleased]` entries to `[0.6.3] - 2026-02-22` section. Leave empty `[Unreleased]`.

## Release steps (per CLAUDE.md)

1. Bump version in 3 files
2. Move CHANGELOG entries
3. Run all quality gates
4. Commit: `chore: release v0.6.3`
5. Build: `rm -rf dist/ && uv build && uvx twine check dist/*`
6. Upload to PyPI: `uvx twine upload dist/*`
7. Tag: `git tag v0.6.3`
8. Push: `git push origin main v0.6.3`
9. Build .mcpb: `bash scripts/build-mcpb.sh`
10. GitHub release: create with CHANGELOG entry, attach both `.mcpb` files
11. Verify: `uv tool install --upgrade punt-langlearn-tts && langlearn-tts doctor`

## Verification

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/ && uv run mypy src/ tests/ && uv run pyright src/ tests/ && uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

OK, we were waiting on punt labs to be approved by PyPI as an org, but there is a transfer function so we can publish in my personal account and then go from there. So you can switch to work on PyPI publishing for langlearn-types.  However ** you need to prefix it with punt- and you need to migrate langlearn-tts to punt- as well. This is been part of our plan.

---

OK, make sure the beads are correct in both projects.

---

Can we run an experiment? I'd like to register langlearn-tts as an MCP service with our claude code session.

---

project-local this is just a quick test.

---

OK, can you use synthesize to say something to me in English?

---

This is f*cking awesome. We are going to be famous.

---

First, we have a small bug.  The rachel voice is somewhere in our prompts and it is wrong.  I have seen that elsewhere.

---

Not sure how to map those to the ones I see in the dashboard, such as https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library?voiceId=1t1EeRixsJrKbiF1zwM6

# Reconcile Project with Punt Labs Standards

Analyze a project against Punt Labs standards and surgically apply fixes. This command
handles files that need **contextual judgment** — workflow customizations, CLAUDE.md
quality, pyproject.toml drift — where a deterministic tool would be too blunt.

## Input

Project path:  (defaults to `.` if empty)

## Process

### 0. Detect Project

Read the project's `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` to determine:

- Language (python, node, swift, or none)
- Project type (application, library, plugin, docs)
- Whether it has an MCP server (`server.py` or MCP-related deps)
- Whether it has a CLI entry point (`[project.scripts]`)

Also read the project's `CLAUDE.md` if it exists — it may document intentional overrides.

### 1. Run Deterministic Audit

Run the mechanical checks first:

```bash
punt audit <project-path>
```

Report the output to the user. The deterministic layer catches missing files, config
gaps, and formatting issues. This command focuses on what `punt audit` cannot: contextual
reconciliation.

### 2. Load Standards

Read the following files from the punt-kit standards directory. If punt-kit is a sibling
directory (i.e., `../punt-kit/` relative to the project), read from the local filesystem.
Otherwise, read from the punt-kit repo on GitHub.

- `standards/python.md` — toolchain, quality gates, project layout
- `standards/github.md` — CI workflows, markdownlint config, action SHA pins
- `standards/cli.md` — required subcommands, init rules
- `standards/distribution.md` — install paths, PyPI publishing
- `standards/plugins.md` — plugin structure (if applicable)

### 3. Reconcile Workflow Files

For each workflow file in `.github/workflows/`:

1. Read the project's current workflow
2. Read the corresponding punt-kit template from `src/punt_kit/templates/workflows/`
3. Identify:
   - **Intentional customizations to PRESERVE**: extra dependencies, cache config,
     system packages (e.g., ffmpeg), coverage integration, project-specific env vars,
     custom test commands, extra linting steps
   - **Missing standard elements to ADD**: new jobs, updated action versions, missing
     timeout settings, missing permissions declarations
   - **Stale elements to UPDATE**: outdated action SHA pins, deprecated syntax

4. Apply changes surgically using the Edit tool — preserve project-specific content,
   add missing standard elements, update stale pins.

**Decision framework for workflows:**

| What you see | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Project has extra steps not in template | PRESERVE — these are intentional |
| Template has steps the project is missing | ADD — explain what and why |
| Action versions differ (project is older) | UPDATE — with the template's version |
| Action versions differ (project is newer) | PRESERVE — project may have intentionally upgraded |
| Project has different cache/dependency config | PRESERVE — project knows its own deps |
| Project is missing timeout-minutes | ADD — use template's value |
| Template has a whole new workflow the project lacks | CREATE — but only the workflow file, not modifications to existing ones |

### 4. Reconcile CLAUDE.md

Check the project's `CLAUDE.md` for:

1. **Required sections present:**
   - `## Standards References` — with links to relevant punt-kit standards
   - `## Quality Gates` — with the actual commands for this project's toolchain

2. **Quality gate accuracy:**
   - Compare the listed commands against what the project actually uses
   - If the project has pyright in deps but CLAUDE.md doesn't mention it → flag
   - If CLAUDE.md lists a command the project can't run → flag

3. **Apply fixes:**
   - Add missing sections (append, don't clobber existing content)
   - Update quality gates to match actual toolchain
   - Do NOT rewrite the user's custom instructions or project description

### 5. Reconcile pyproject.toml (Python projects only)

Compare the project's `[tool.*]` sections against the Python standard:

| Section | Standard | Check |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `[tool.ruff]` | line-length=88, target-version="py313" | Report if different |
| `[tool.ruff.lint]` | select includes E, F, I, UP, B, SIM, TCH | Report missing rule sets |
| `[tool.mypy]` | strict=true | Report if not strict |
| `[tool.pyright]` | typeCheckingMode="strict" | Report if not strict |
| `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` | testpaths=["tests"] | Report if missing |

**Do NOT auto-fix pyproject.toml** — these settings affect build behavior and need human
judgment. Report drift with a clear recommendation. Example:

> `[tool.ruff] target-version` is `"py312"` but standard is `"py313"`. This may be
> intentional if the project supports Python 3.12. Confirm before updating.

### 6. Report Summary

After all checks, print a structured summary:

```text
## Reconciliation Report

### Applied (safe fixes)
- ✓ Added timeout-minutes to lint.yml
- ✓ Created release.yml from template
- ✓ Added Standards References section to CLAUDE.md

### Needs Review (human judgment required)
- ⚠ pyproject.toml: ruff target-version is py312, standard is py313
- ⚠ lint.yml: uses actions/checkout@abc123 but template uses @def456

### Already Compliant
- ✓ docs.yml matches template
- ✓ CLAUDE.md has all required sections
- ✓ pyproject.toml tool configs are standard-compliant
```

## Important Rules

1. **Never delete project-specific content.** Reconciliation is additive. If you're
   unsure whether something is intentional, preserve it and flag it for review.

2. **Explain every change.** Before applying an edit, tell the user what you're changing
   and why. Reference the specific standard that requires it.

3. **Respect CLAUDE.md overrides.** If a project's CLAUDE.md explicitly says "we use X
   instead of Y", that override wins. Don't flag it as drift.

4. **One project at a time.** Even if you can see sibling directories, only reconcile
   the specified project path.

5. **Deterministic checks belong in `punt audit`.** If you find yourself wanting to add
   a mechanical check (file exists? config key present?), note it as a potential
   `punt audit` enhancement instead.
