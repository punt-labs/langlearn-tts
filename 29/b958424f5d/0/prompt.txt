Implement the following plan:

# Release v0.6.3

## Context

The output directory consolidation fix (PR #29, lltts-612) is merged to main. Users on `0.6.2` may get files written to cwd instead of `~/langlearn-audio`. We need to release `0.6.3` to PyPI and build a new `.mcpb` Desktop Extension bundle.

## Version bump: 0.6.2 → 0.6.3

Three files to update:
- `pyproject.toml:3` — `version = "0.6.2"` → `"0.6.3"`
- `src/langlearn_tts/__init__.py:7` — `__version__ = "0.6.2"` → `"0.6.3"`
- `manifest.json:5` — `"version": "0.6.2"` → `"0.6.3"`

## CHANGELOG

Move `[Unreleased]` entries to `[0.6.3] - 2026-02-22` section. Leave empty `[Unreleased]`.

## Release steps (per CLAUDE.md)

1. Bump version in 3 files
2. Move CHANGELOG entries
3. Run all quality gates
4. Commit: `chore: release v0.6.3`
5. Build: `rm -rf dist/ && uv build && uvx twine check dist/*`
6. Upload to PyPI: `uvx twine upload dist/*`
7. Tag: `git tag v0.6.3`
8. Push: `git push origin main v0.6.3`
9. Build .mcpb: `bash scripts/build-mcpb.sh`
10. GitHub release: create with CHANGELOG entry, attach both `.mcpb` files
11. Verify: `uv tool install --upgrade punt-langlearn-tts && langlearn-tts doctor`

## Verification

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/ && uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/ && uv run mypy src/ tests/ && uv run pyright src/ tests/ && uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

OK, we were waiting on punt labs to be approved by PyPI as an org, but there is a transfer function so we can publish in my personal account and then go from there. So you can switch to work on PyPI publishing for langlearn-types.  However ** you need to prefix it with punt- and you need to migrate langlearn-tts to punt- as well. This is been part of our plan.

---

OK, make sure the beads are correct in both projects.

---

Can we run an experiment? I'd like to register langlearn-tts as an MCP service with our claude code session.

---

project-local this is just a quick test.

---

OK, can you use synthesize to say something to me in English?

---

This is f*cking awesome. We are going to be famous.

---

First, we have a small bug.  The rachel voice is somewhere in our prompts and it is wrong.  I have seen that elsewhere.

---

Not sure how to map those to the ones I see in the dashboard, such as https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library?voiceId=1t1EeRixsJrKbiF1zwM6
